# binary_trees
This project is a binary tree program that can proccess text files alphabetically by using a binary search tree.There is also a 
console interface class that when run will allow the user to create their own binary search tree by adding, deleting, and searching for words
in said tree. The binary search tree is based off of hardcoded file locations for the file processor. The file processor is a school project while the
console interface is a side addition to the original assignment. The binary tree contains binary nodes implimenting a treenode interface.
The file processor also contains a hasher that will take the words added to the data structure and add them as unsorted linked lists based on string
values. The linked lists are comprised of nodes implimenting linked list nodes interface (LLnode). There are two kinds of hashers, a single and total hasher.
These hashers will store strings based on different algorithims for the strings numerical value. All programs are console based.
*NOTE* The assignment for my school project required that the file path for the file processor's text file be a hard coded location and not input 
via a console request. Therefore the default file location is still set to MY COMPUTERS file path for the last file used.
